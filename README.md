AriaAccordion
=============

AriaAccordion is a JavaScript class that adds accordion functionalities to
structured HTML tags with Aria support.

It is a rewriting of the [jQuery Accessible Accordion System, using ARIA](https://github.com/nico3333fr/jquery-accessible-accordion-aria) from Nicolas
Hoffmann. The main difference is that AriaAccordion does not use jQuery.

Requirements
------------

No external library is needed but AriaAccordion uses ES6 features. The browser
on which you will run AriaAccordion must conform the this specification.

Usage
-----

See [sample.html](sample.html) and [sample-nested.html](sample-nested.html)
for quick information.
